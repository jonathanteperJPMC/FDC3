### What are OKRs? 

How do we know we are working on the right thing? How do we know our working groups & programs are working toward concerted goals? How do we measure success? The Objectives & Key Results (OKR) framework helps us answer these questions. 

The main goal of OKRs is to connect company, team and personal objectives to measurable results, making people move together in right direction. OKRs should be measurable goals that are aligned across an organization to create a golden thread of objectives. Key benefits of OKRs include increased clarity, focus, and collaboration.
