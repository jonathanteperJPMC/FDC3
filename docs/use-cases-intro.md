# About

### Overview

The purpose of the Use Cases Working Group (UCWG) is (a) to document and ratify business use cases that drive the standards created under the other FDC3 working groups, and (b) to measure the impact of FDC3 interoperability.

### Charter

The goal of FDC3 is to create standards for desktop application interoperability in the financial industry. For these standards to be successful we need ensure they satisfy a set of foundational use cases and requirements defined and validated by the program participants. These use cases must represent the interop needs of the 40+ members of FDC3 as a sample of the financial industry as a whole. The remaining working groups Context Data, App Directory, Intents and APIs should use the use cases as the basis for each set of standards.

Until this point the existing working groups have focused on the functional requirements for interop standards with specifications based on assumptions of what is required. To ensure that the standards will enable the scalable interop interactions that we want, we need to validate these assumptions. This should not delay the work of the existing working groups, but happen in parallel with the requirements maintained as the program matures. 

Unlike the other working groups, 'Use Cases' should provide requirements only not solutions. The requirements and use cases defined should not be specific to a handful of products that are represented within the working group, but apply to the workflows present across the financial industry.

# Contribution Guidelines

### Acceptance Guidelines

These guidelines have been approved by the Use Cases Working Group in August of 2019.  They started as an 'opinionated' discussion document, followed by discussions, and then votes on what Use Cases (UC) the Working Group (WG) should accept. Having a set of agreed guidelines provides two benefits: (1) improving consistency in reviewing the use cases to accept in FDC3, (2) the act of producing these guidelines should allow certain recurring points to be discussed and agreed once, rather than raising them in each UC discussion.

The Guidelines as adopted are not a final arbiter of which Use Cases are valid, that should always be the responsibility of the WG responding to each Use Case. However, where these Guidelines are not followed, the WG should provide a comment to indicate which guidelines are being relaxed and why that decision was taken to help promote consistency.

It is important to note that the goal of consistency in decisions should not be used to prevent changes to the way the WG operates, it would however be good to update these Guidelines as the WG practice changes.

Accepted Use Cases will be shared with the relevant Working Groups. There is no requirement that any of the other Working Groups will ‘work’ on the Use Case; for example, a WG might :

* reject a UC
* add the UC to their backlog
* indicate that the UC is already supported and show how the specification is used to deliver the UC.
But it is expected that the WG's will at least update the UC WG Confluence page with their decision and a brief 'reason'.

Please continue to engage with these Guidelines either by comments or by creating an alternative set of guidelines and referencing them in a comment on this page.
